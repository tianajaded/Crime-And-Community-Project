# Final-Data-Science-Project-
Analyzing Crime and Community Statistics

## Instructions
The report will be evaluated on the following criteria:
•‘Big Question’: Is the question interesting, clearly stated, and specific? Is the chosen dataset a
reasonable option for addressing this question?
•Visualizations: Are the visualizations used to represent the analysis effective and complete?
•Analysis: Are the methods that we used to analyze the data appropriate and carried out correctly?
Is the analysis thorough and logically conducted?
•Conclusions: Do the final conclusions provide a satisfactory answer to the ‘Big Question’ ? Are the
conclusions supported by the analysis that was performed and presented?
•Reproducibility: Are the data processing and cleaning methods well-documented? Is the code used
to analyze the data correct and easily interpretable?
•Presentation: Is the final report well organized and neat? Are the plots designed with care, including
color choices, appropriate labelling, and other aspects of good visualization design?


## •	A brief description of the dataset you have selected
I have chosen to do the crime and community dataset. I am very interested in this one, because I am curious to know what the statistics are for myself. 
In issues involving crime and community, I feel like the media often gives narratives siding with one extreme or the other, and I’m curious to conduct my own analysis 
and find out for myself what the real numbers actually are. My biggest question of interest relating to the analysis in a broader sense is just “is the media telling 
the truth” about crime and community stats, and seeing what story the data itself tells. The results are important and relevant to myself, and to the community at large.
